# GENAI-Practice 🚀  

This repository documents my **hands-on journey in Generative AI** — starting with the book **_Hands-On Generative AI with Transformers and Diffusion Models_** and expanding to other resources such as research papers, tutorials, and experiments.  

It will serve as my **living knowledge base** for concepts, code, and insights as I progress through the GenAI roadmap.

## 📚 Starting Point: The Book  

My exploration begins with the excellent book:  
**[Hands-On Generative AI with Transformers and Diffusion Models](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Generative-Transformers-Diffusion-Models/dp/1098149246)**  
by **Omar Sanseviero**, **Pedro Cuenca**, **Apolinario Passos**, and **Jonathan Whitaker**.

The official GitHub repository for the book can be found here:  
🔗 [https://github.com/genaibook/genaibook](https://github.com/genaibook/genaibook)  

The book covers:  
- Fundamentals of Transformers and Diffusion Models  
- Compressing and representing information  
- Stable Diffusion & conditional generation  
- Fine-tuning for text and image models  
- Creative applications (text-to-image, audio, etc.)  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## 🧠 Learning Approach  

1. **Follow along with the book** — run the Colab notebooks, tweak parameters, and document observations.  
2. **Deep dive** — study referenced research papers and related resources.  
3. **Experiment** — build small projects using concepts learned.  
4. **Iterate** — refine notes, optimize code, and explore new ideas.
